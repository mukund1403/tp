### Project: Split-liang

Split Liang is an application that helps you split expenses with friends in a fun way! If you are tired of keeping track 
of calculating who owes who, Split-liang is here to help you. Split-liang allows you to keep track through the creation 
of groups and expenses so that you can simultaneously manage expenses with multiple friend groups!


### Summary of Contributions

Given below are my contributions to the project:

* **New Feature** Added the ability to add expenses to a group.
  * What it does: allows a new expense to be added to the group. The expense added can be split equally or unequally 
    between users. It can also be in any currency. 
  * Justification: This is a key feature to the working of the app since it helps with the expense tracking.
  * Highlights: The merging of existing code with the Money class required major refactoring of the code since all 
  float amounts had to be replaced with the instances of the Money object. 

* **New Feature** Added the ability to list all expenses within a group.
  * What it does: shows all the expenses in the group along with all the details.
  * Justification: Users can see all expenses to keep track or even choose which ones to delete

* **New Feature** Added the ability to delete expenses within a group.
  * What it does: Allows users to delete existing expenses by referring to list index.
  * Justification: This feature gives users greater flexibility in managing their expenses and also allows them to 
  fix mistakes they make when keying in the expense details.
